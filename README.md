================

Dynamic programming algorithms for reconstructing indoor Manhattan scenes

This code was exported from
https://manhattan-vision.googlecode.com/svn and checked in here, using
git-svn to retain versioning history etc. That SVN repository (and
hence the code here) represents all the latest code at the point that
I left Oxford. However, there are numerous data files, build
artefacts, plots, and feature files that were too large to check in to
SVN, so those are not here. They are on my backup drive at
Backups/AVL\ Home\ Dir/Code/indoor_context, and on my macbook pro at
Code/old/old_indoor_context_repos.
